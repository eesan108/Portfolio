# Cat task to-do list
## Ethan Christensen

I am an aspiring software developer, studying for over 6 months. I am looking for an internship or mentorship in the Manawatu region in New Zealand. 

In this repository is a To-do list project. With this project, I have learned how to:
  - Add custom tasks to different array categories
  - Delete tasks
  - Detect if all tasks are checked off
  - Style the project with CSS
  - Create button placement that has good UI structure.
